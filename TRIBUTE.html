<h1 id="id1"> A BFIEF INFO ABOUT HIS LIFE </h1>
<img class="im1" alt="soccer" src="messi_child.JPG" style="width:350px;height:350px;">
<ul class="ulall">

<li>Lionel Andrés Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario,Argentina.Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.</li>
<li>At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.</li>
<li>He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.</li>

<h1 class="abc"> HIS STYLE OF PLAY </h1>
<img class="mess" alt="soccer" src="messi4.JPG" style="width:600px;height:500px;" >
<ul class="ulall" >
<li> One of the most prolific goalscorers and clinical finishers of all time, Messi is known for his powerful and accurate striking ability from both inside and outside the area, as well as his positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. While he is renowned for his eye for goal, he also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing.</li>
<li> He is frequently described as a "conjurer", creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.</li> 
<li> He is also an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker. </li>
<li> Although his conversion rate from free kicks was initially low towards the beginning of his career, he later developed into one of the best free kick takers in the world, and is even considered by certain pundits to be one of the greatest set piece specialists of all time.</li>
<li> Messi's pace, technical ability, and close control at speed, combined with his awareness and understanding of space, enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.</li>
</ul>
<img class="acb" alt="soccer" src="messi5.JPG" >
<ul class="ulall" >
<li> As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch, and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in world football.</li> 
<li> His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis.</li> 
<li> Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.</li>
<li> With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.</li>
